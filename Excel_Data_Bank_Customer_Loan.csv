I did not accomplish what I set out to do.  So I am reaching out to the lending club community again.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to negotiate with the banks, but they really won't budge at this juncture.<br><br>My plan is to consolidate 2 cards 1 with $7,000 (approx) outstanding and 1 with about $5,500 outanding into 1 payment (Lending Club) whereby the monthly amount I am paying back will be less than the monthly revolving.<br><br>I have been employed for 6 years and have a steady job at BOA.  I also plan to use any tax returns, etc to help accelerate paying this and my other debts off early.<br><br>I have paid every lending club payment on-time and will continue to do so.  Again, I would much rather take out the middle man and have a fixed amount to pay with a fixed term (this ensures I do not fall into this trap again).

The property in question is a two-family home in a prime real estate location where values have not fallen by any significant degree. I currently live on the second floor and have a long-term, reliable tenant on the first floor. My aim is to bring the house up to its full potential through these projects and then keep the property indefinitely. Funds from the loan will also free up existing cash on hand, which will be used to eliminate other existing credit balances. I am self-employed as a freelance translator and over the course of eight years of experience in my current role I have never had any shortage of work; because of my position as a B2B service provider for critical sectors such as heavy industry, pharmaceutical, and IT, demand is diversified and constant. I have top professional ratings and excellent credit history, and have secured quality professionals to undertake the project at hand at a fair price.

I withdrew most of the funds from my brokerage account 3 years ago to pay off a credit card, and to assist a friend in getting rid of some of her inefficient debt a well.  I have since been recompensed over time (charged her no interest).  My mortgage debt is structured very efficiently.  5.0% fixed 30 year mortgage, 5.24% (prime minus 1.26% variable) HELOC.  I traded profitably for 3 years, and never blew up my account.  Only one of my 3 years showed a net loss (very small one at that) and the other two showed moderate profits.  The technicals -------------------- - My credit score, according to Transunion (Dec 8, 2007) is 784.  - I have a home - Bank owns 80%, I own 20% in equity so far, and I'm gaining on them!  Unlike some poor folks who are now upside down in their mortgages I bought in 2002 and have seen handsome appreciation in my area, despite sub-prime crisis.  I've felt the effects but its not as pronounced here. - I am 37, professional software engineer at a Chicago software company - I traded part time for 3 years, and intend to continue this endeavor once I am fully capitalized again.   - I do not trade derivatives at this time (futures/options).  I trade strictly in equities at this time, and don't plan on using derivaties at this time.  I think futures, especially, are too risky for a part-timer, or even an under-prepared full-timer, so I'm staying completely away from them for the forseeable future. - Net assets (including 401K which is considered a non-liquid asset due to taxation on it) is about $130,000.  And thats a conservative estimate.  My 401K comprises about $110,000 of that. - My monthly take-home from salary is about $4800 - I have one credit card with a balance on it, much of that debt is 0%, and almost half carries a 9.9% rate.  - I am an INTj  Any questions, feel free to ask.

That will save me $25 a month on my regular budget. Then I plan to take the remaining $13,000 and pay down my large Visa balance which is currently at 19.99%. The Lending Club loan repayment will not be difficult to work into my budget because I will be replacing my auto loan with it.<br/>null Borrower added on 09/13/11 > I'm disappointed that my loan has not been fully funded yet. I feel like I have proven with my excellent credit score that I don't mess around with things like money. I don't feel it is acceptable to miss a payment on an obligation; I don't feel it is acceptable to not take care of my finances. Having said that, things happen, and over the past few years, I was not able to meet some unexpected personal needs with cash. These needs are resolved and I would like some money to get my use of credit back on track. For starters, I would prefer to pay personal investors 15% interest than a credit card company 20% interest! Out of college, I worked for a fortune 500 company for 8 years and then relocated and have been working for a different fortune 500 company since the spring of 2005. I have been promoted twice since working for my current company; once in 2006 and again just a few months ago. The industry I'm working in and the job I have is not going anywhere in the foreseeable future. I feel very secure in my profession and my current role. There is absolutely no doubt that the loan I'm applying for through Lending Club has been thoroughly researched, fits into my budget, and will be repaid within the boundaries of the lending agreement.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation Loan,660xx,KS,19.01

I am new to the Lending Club and so I thought I might share with you why I am looking to the Lending Club for some financial assistance.  <br/><br/>In 2009 I made some bad credit choices by applying for a card from my local bank that carried an annual fee in addition to a high intrest rate.  No, problem, I thought, I won't be using this credit card anyway.  A few months later I got into an apartment and my room mate bailed on me the day I signed the lease.  I now had an apartment which I could not afford all on my own.  I also just got a new job for the new area I was in.  I couldn't afford to stay there but I couldn't afford to break the lease either.  So, I used the credit card to end the lease and move again and get my old job back.  It was a series of poor planning and bad financial decisions.  <br/><br/>If you invest in me, I plan to consolidate all of these high intrest cards (I have 1 and 2 lower intrest cards) and pay them off and close the high-intrest, annual fee one.  I can pay off the last $1800 on my CarMax car loan and be done with that one too.  With just one loan at a better rate I can focus on improving and aquiring a better income by adding on a part-time job.  My plan is to be debt free in 4 years.  <br/><br/>Thank you so much for your intrest in becoming my investor of my debt consolidation loan.  I appreciate your kind welcome and I will be a Lending Club success story.  Thank you!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Debt Consolidation loan ,910xx,CA,11.81

This way I can reap the benefits of free travel while avoiding the finance charges of carrying a balance.<br/><br/>There are healthcare finance companies that fund these types of loans, but  the interest rates are higher than what Lending Club offers, with rates that can rise during the life of the loan.  In addition, healthcare providers typically add a fee (usually 10% of total surgery costs) to procedures that are financed through these companies due to the fact that they are charged fees as well.

Therefore, I just want to slash my monthly spending on paying off debts and could have extra money left for family saving.  I believe warm-hearted people are always around.

I have cost myself the financial freedom/comfort level that I work so hard to maintain for myself and family. This amount of money will allow me to get back on my feet and be secure again. I am extremely dependable with my strongest characteristic being that I hate disappointing people whether it be my family, employer or in this case, someone that will be funding my loan.  Over the last 3 years I have made on average 150k+ a year- My mortgage payments are only $2,500 a month which will allow the re-payment process to be handled easily and without any issue.

Currently I have 4 distributors, but I also have a good bit of debt because of some bad advice over the years, bad moves in marketing, recent expansion, and a customer who spent much of this summer ordering large quantities then telling me to hold it in the warehouse (thus destroying my cash flow).  The worst thing, though, was doing my financing with credit cards.  Bear with me for the whole situation...<br/><br/>I keep my business finances and personal finances completely separate, with the single exception that the 4 credit cards are personally guaranteed, although they &quot;belong&quot; to the business.  Personally I have no debt beyond my mortgage; we only have one credit card in case of emergencies.  My professional income (I am employed full time as a research chemist) ensures that the business is a hobby, although a somewhat lucrative one, and income from it has paid for vacations, lessons for the kids, etc.<br/><br/>I have always carried 10-20k debt on the business side because I could get by with that and I kept saying I'd get it all paid off eventually, but now, having expanded the business over the past couple of years and hitting some hiccups alluded to above which really hurt my cash flow, I'm now carrying around 46k at about 30% APR.<br/><br/>I'm whittling this down and have turned to some others to help with the money management to finally get serious about paying close attention to cash flow and debt load.  And part of that is trying to ease that monthly slam of interest.  This loan will be to help lower the amount that goes to interest every month so that it can instead go to principal.<br/>",small_business,Credit Cards Built my Business(doh!!),181xx,PA,24.17

He was under a doctor&rsquo;s care for various ailments at that time and the prescriptions in addition to the doctor&rsquo;s fees every month were outrageous. Needless to say a lot of these expenses went onto the high interest rate credit cards that we own, so that at the time we were still able to afford all of the necessities that go along with everyday life, such as maintaining our home and vehicles, etc. Thank goodness a little over a year and a half ago he was hired as a full time employee (with full benefits) at a well-known shipyard.  We&rsquo;ve always considered ourselves to be a financially stable couple and we&rsquo;re fortunate that we have been able to pay our bills on time every month; however it&rsquo;s still unsettling to be several thousands of dollars in credit card debt that we were never accustomed to before. It&rsquo;s overwhelming and seems as though there&rsquo;s no end in sight sometimes.

We make a very solid stable income, as I mentioned before, my income has been verified above at over $9.6K a month, but what isn't factored into that number is that my wife brings in almost half of that number $4.3K, bringing our monthly gross income to over $13K, it is almost $9.5K NET with expenses that barely touch $7.5K with this loan repayment figure factored in.<br/><br/>2. We currently do not use credit cards at all...this revolving debt comes from a period in our lives when we were finishing college and starting our family, our credit profile is not an accurate depiction of our current situation.<br/><br/>3. We have never missed a payment for anything and I am not about to start, we crave the automation and the simplistic nature of being able to have one payment that is static, it will allow us to save in excess of $15K - $20K a year, some of which can be translated into quicker loan repayment.<br/><br/>Thank you for your consideration of our loan, and thank you to all of the investors that are already guranteed to make an ROI with this investment.<br/> Borrower added on 12/09/10 > Thank you to everyone who has invested in our loan, you have made a great decision and we wont let you down, get ready to make some money!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Thomas Consolidation Loan,201xx,VA,8.94

I would rather not give out the exact location details of which dealership but if you check online you will see the storage package I plan on getting.  Again, I thank you tremendously for asking questions. I had actually wrote a long loan description last friday night but for some reason Lendingclub never updated it on my loan homepage. In any event, for the last 6 years I have been very comfortable as co-owner and Chief Operating Officer of a 35 year old family owned wholesale/retail operation on the North Shore of Long Island. We have managed to weather out the last 3 years of economic turmoil on long island and maintain 5 year back revenue figures which leads me to my next line. God bless, I am currently in a very positive place in my life and finally know the time is right to apply for a loan like this and instead of buying my bike outright pay over 3 years. So, this loan will give me the opportunity to pay it over time, that is the only reason for applying at Lendingclub. A Lendingclub loan takes a lot of the stress away from a major purchase.

I got &quot;everything&quot; in the divorce, meaning all of the debt, including his student loans because we consolidated our loans. Servicing that debt was initially manageable because of my perfect payment history and some good teaser rates on balance transfers. Then, in anticipation of financial reform the interest rates on my cards shot up. Additionally, the credit lines were slashed, so my credit utilization ratio went up, causing my FICO score to go down. Then a number of teaser rates expired, and I was hardly making any progress on getting the debt under control due to crushing interest rates. <br/>When the financial reform finally kicked in, and the banks were required to apply credit card payments to the balance with the highest interest rate after satisfying the minimum payment, I started getting back on track. In the past 2 years I have reduced my credit card debt by almost half. I continue to cut expenses, live off of cash, and chisel away at the debt as much as possible. <br/>Happily, Chase and Bank of America are out of my life. Now the focus is on American Express, which despite my perfect payment record has a high interest rate and reduces my credit line every time I pay it down by a few thousand dollars, so it looks like I always have the card maxed out even though I haven&rsquo;t made a charge on that account in 4 years. This loan will allow me to move Amex debt to a lower fixed interest rate. I can&rsquo;t wait to get out from under Amex&rsquo;s thumb!<br/>I have practiced law for 13 years and am a partner in a 5-attorney (3 partners, 2 associates) boutique transactional law firm. Despite the economy our business has thrived for the past 2 years thanks to our oil &amp; gas practice, which is booming. All indications are that we will have plenty of O&amp;G work going forward. Meanwhile, our commercial real estate practice, which has been languishing, is starting to pick up and I anticipate that workload will steadily increase. We have recently started working on raw land acquisition for developers of single-family subdivisions. That work was the first to die off when the economy went bad, so I think this new activity bodes well for the recovery here in Texas, which was never as hard-hit as most of the nation. Housing will spur retail development, and industrial and office will follow that. We&rsquo;re even seeing some significant commercial lending. I feel very fortunate to be in the position of anticipating growth in our business while so many others are suffering. <br/>Bottom line, my interim goal is to get all of the remaining debt down to the lowest interest rate possible and ideally off of credit cards completely. I would rather pay interest to Lending Club investors than the companies who have made my life miserable the past 4 years. My overall goal, of course, is getting out of debt altogether so I can start investing in Lending Club loans myself.<br/>",credit_card,Adios American Express!,782xx,TX,18.7

I am the sole wage earner and have no children or child care expenses.  I do currently have enough in 401K to NOT take out a loan, but don't want to go the cash-out route for a number of reasons (tax purposes and retirement considerations at the very top of that list).<br/><br/>The credit debt is a mixture of consumer purchases, auto repairs, medical, dental, and veterinary bills, plus (honestly), some fun and vacation expenses.<br/><br/>I am paid an hourly rate at my primary job (employed there for 6 years, this month), and my minimum net income is approximately $3100/month and will max out at approximately $3800/month net, depending on the available overtime.  <br/><br/>Here are my approximate outstanding debts/interest rates/monthly payments (I've been attempting to pay beyond the minimum every month on the higher rates, as I can):<br/><br/>acct1 $14360 /  20.01% / $330<br/>acct2 $11873 / 16.65% /  $330<br/>acct3 $1046 / 16.99% /  $100<br/>acct4 $5846 / 22.99%/  $300<br/>acct5 $3922 / 26.24% / $150<br/><br/>TOTAL consumer debt expenses: approximately $1210/month<br/><br/>This loan would allow me to completely pay off the three highest-interest balances (&gt;20%).  Those are amazingly not penalty rates!  I do have a large sum debt, but I earn a decent wage and never submit a late payment.  This is important to me personally.<br/><br/>This loan would allow me to reduce my overall interest rates by quite a bit, and pay this down at a much more aggressive schedule, while paying slightly (~$25) less per month than I'm doing now.  As I said, I do make enough now to pay my bills on time every month, but I'm not making near enough progress, and am not able to build up decent savings beyond 401K.  <br/><br/>As a side note, I'd like to also mention that I've recently done a few things to help my myself regardless of the outcome of this loan.  I've cut my TV service and gym membership entirely (savings of $190/month) and picked up a second, part-time job this month.   This job will increase my income by approximately $500-$600/month, a positive swing in my favor.<br/><br/>That leaves the following expenses:<br/>-rent, $1075/month<br/>-gas and electric, approx $35/month combined<br/>-cell phone, approx $150/month<br/>-internet, $30/month<br/><br/>TOTAL monthly expenses (consumer debt listed above included): approx $2500/month<br/><br/>There hasn't been a great deal left after groceries, gas/auto, and any entertainment, so as I said, it's been a challenge to save and pay this debt down at a decent rate at all.<br/><br/>I feel like this is a very doable thing for me and could do it on my own regardless, but the opportunity for the loan here would save me quite a bit of money and put me on a much more favorable timetable, and I'm very excited to get started on this and pay these debts.  Again, thanks for those who have invested their help already, and to those who have expressed enough interest to ask for more info.  Sorry for being so wordy, but I wanted to be thorough.  Thanks again.<br/>",debt_consolidation,JakeLoan,908xx,CA,15.97

Which leaves about a $600.00 a month for myself, my son and my husband to whatever groceries, neccesities and etc. needed. Please understand my brief description and give the most consideration to my account if possible. I would greatly appreciate it. Please contact me if you have any questions or concerns. I greatly appreciate it! Thank you!<br/><br/>Robyn<br/> Borrower added on 10/13/10 > I also assure you that I am a very responsible &amp; reliable adult. I haven't been late on any of my bills since 2004 (I turned 18 in 2003 and made some immature mistakes) I try to pay more than the minimum payment. I work part time, I go to school full time for my Bachelors in Nursing which I will be getting in 2012 and I am 1st time mother of a 15 month old. This is another brief description about me to help guide you to make any amount of consideration on your decision about my loan. Please feel free to contact me for any questions or concerns. I will greatly appreciate everything and anything that you plan to offer. I hope my additional information will help you make your decision more easy and comfortable. Thank you.<br/> Borrower added on 10/14/10 > To clear any confusion, I saw that my profile stated I make $4167/monthly this includes mine's and my husband's monthly income. His monthly income goes all to rent, utilities, cable, &amp; phones. I apologize if that has caused any confusion because I stated above that I make about $2000/monthly. I also wanted to take the time to break down my monthly expenses to help give you an idea how I manage my finances.<br/>Credit Cards: <br/>Chase $1997 Monthly payment (MP): $200-$300 <br/>Kay Jewelers $2200 MP: $225-$300<br/>Orchard $286 MP: $30-$50<br/>Capital $741 MP: $100-$125<br/>Rewardzone $733 MP: $100-$125<br/>TOTAL MP: $655-$900 plus $636 monthly car payment = $1291-$1536 TOTAL towards debt and car <br/>Which then leaves $464-$709 for everything else such as gas, groceries, food, necessities and things that are needed.<br/><br/>If I am approved for this loan it will help improve my credit score because all my cards would be paid off, I would be able to make a much more affordable monthly payment towards one account (this loan) and my family and I wouldn't have to struggle living paycheck to paycheck. <br/><br/>The reason why I got in so much debt was because of school. My first 2 years of college, I did not qualify for financial aid so I had to use my cards to help pay for my books, school supplies and school expenses. Now that I am working part-time I qualify for grants but I am still left with these debts. I would love to just consolidate them all into one lower monthly payment and get out of having to keep up with all of them. This loan will definitely do that. Thank you again for your time and consideration. I appreciate it all greatly!<br/>",debt_consolidation,Improve credit with debt consolidation,945xx,CA,14.54

I ended up with $5,000 in tax debt. I had some savings to pay a large part  of this debt, but unfortunately my husband had to have an unexpected surgery in April, depleting our savings and leaving us with almost $2,000.00 in medical bills. I have made payment agreements with both the IRS and our medical provider but the monthly payments are putting very tight constraints on our monthly cash flow. I am looking to refinance this debt for a short term (36 months at much lower monthly payments) in order to create some space in our monthly cash flow and and allowing us to stay current on our 2010 quarterly estimated tax payments as well as build up savings for future unexpected expenses. This loan would not be additional debt, we are looking to convert some high monthly payments into more manageable monthly payments.<br/><br/><br/>My approximate monthly budget :<br/><br/>Income: $8,600.00 +/- (net of business expenses including health/dental insurance and tax withholding)<br/><br/>Mortgage $2,298.00<br/>Groceries $800.00<br/>Insurance (auto/life) $320.00<br/>Utilities: $650.00 (including internet &amp; cell phone)<br/>Auto/ Fuel $220.00<br/>Childcare: $400<br/>Credit Card Payments: $572.00<br/>Clothing/Personal Items/Personal Care $275.00<br/>Restaurants/Entertainment $125.00<br/>Education: $1800.00<br/>Medical $100.00<br/>Savings $200.00<br/>Other Non-Discretionary $250.00<br/><br/>IRS Tax Debt $500.00/mo<br/>Medical Debt (surgery) $300.00/mo<br/> <br/>These last two payments would be converted into a single $195.00 payment with this loan.<br/><br/>If I am able to reduce my combined IRS and Medical Debt to a much lower payment, that will enable me to run a positive cash flow once again.<br/><br/>I am aware of 2 late payments recorded on my credit report. These are a result of me not updating the accounts on 2 of my automatic payments in a timely manner when one my banks went in to receivership,(and was eventually taken over by another bank.) These accounts are now current. One was on a car payment that has since been paid off. The other was on a rarely used business credit card. I set up most of my payments on an automatic system. I will make sure all account information is up-to-date and accurate on all future automatic payments.<br/><br/><br/>I have had my private practice in speech therapy for over 5 years and have had over 5% growth in net income each year, with about 7% in 2009. Prior to my own practice I worked in the schools for over 5 years. Currently, speech therapists, both locally and nationwide are in high demand. The need is increasing while the number and size of graduate programs is limited. In other words, I am very employable, even without my own private practice.<br/>",debt_consolidation,DebtCon,980xx,WA,9.84

As I have stated here through Q&amp;A, as well as loan description, we don't have bad credit, we just don't have much credit, and the credit we do have, we have maxed in order to provide what I felt my family needed. The total family debt we are going to consolidate with this loan came over the course of the last 10 years. I moved from New Orleans to Colorado after culinary school. My wife and I couldn't afford a big wedding with family, so we eloped in Vegas alone. We maxed my Discover card to cover the birth of our youngest son who is now 3 because at the time we had no family health insurance. We have for the last 2 years obtained health insurance and are all fully covered. And we sent our oldest son to a school in New Orleans for talented musicians for 2 years. All of these cover our total debt of  $16,000 for everything we have amassed over the last 10 years, and we would desperately enjoy a fresh start with only 1 monthly payment of $420 as our loan here specifies. We never miss ANY payments of ANY KIND, and we certainly don't intend to start NOW. So we have balanced our budget, but continue to pay over $800/month to these creditors, but with this loan could wipe out completely as well as pay the loan back early and pocket some much needed monthly funds for my family rather than just give it to creditor interest.<br/>",debt_consolidation,Our Consolidation Loan,805xx,CO,17.29

I&rsquo;d like to introduce myself and explain the purpose of my loan. I&rsquo;m 33 years old and have been paying bills since I was 18. I have never made a late payment on any credit card, car loan, rent, etc. I am not married nor do I have children. I have a great job at a mortgage company that is close to home and has full medical benefits. I&rsquo;ve been working there for six and a half years, the company has been in business for 28 years. You can see their website at www.mountainmortgagecorp.com.<br/><br/>I have a very small monthly budget. Rent $893, Phone and Internet $70, Electric $50, Gas $20, Car Insurance $120, Food $130, Credit Cards $150, Miscellaneous $30. This all totals $1463.<br/><br/>The purpose of my loan is to help me start a side business. I have been a computer programmer since I got out of high school and for the last few years I've been programming game engines for all the major independent gaming platforms (Xbox, Iphone, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Windows Phone 7, Google, PC, Mac) so I can tap into the booming independent games market. My engines are complete for a number of games with place holder art. The money I wish to borrow would be used for a few different things. First to pay professional artists and musicians to add high quality art and music to the games. To purchase the proper equipment to fully test all the games on all the platforms and operating systems. To pay for professional advertising and viral marketing campaigns. And finally to add professional content to my e-commerce website which will promote/sell the games and merchandise. I'm taking this side business very seriously. This loan amount would cover everything I need to create a very professional presence and ensure quality recognition in the future. If I get this loan quickly I'll have a few of the games out before December and be able to take advantage of all the extra purchases made during the Holiday Season. I think that about covers it. But should anyone have any other questions, please feel free to ask. Thanks!<br/><br/>P.S. I read that it is better to be proactive on the Credit Review Status so I called Lending Club today and asked if there is anything I can do to speed up the process. Their representative told me there wasn't and that I just had to wait for the Credit Review team to get to my file. I hope they get to it soon.

That was alot of info i had down about me, maybe to much.  Anyway...  <br/>   Short Version.= I am 31  and i recently became a first time buyer home owner this year.  I had some good luck, I been saving 3 years ago more than half my monthly paycheck been going to my saving account., also about year and half ago i decided to start fixing my credit, it was 561 and to this day it is at a 741.  I have to admit it was perfect timing when I picked out this brand new 3b/2b 2200 sq ft house for 120k. I been planning this out for such a long time.  I gave alot of dedication, money, and work into buying a house, and it payed off. Plus made it in time for the first time buyer tax credit.   I researched what i needed to put down: 20% and found out the closing cost was around 5k.  I been working since the middle of 2003 at our family exporting business to Latin America, With the recession happening our business kept running strong, we all notice some change but kept on moving.  Our company exports fertilizer, insecticides, and pesticides  that are biodegradable and environmentally .safe  for the farms down there.  It is a very good and stable job, people need to eat.  I been living in my new house for about 5-6 months.  I figured that the left over money i had left the buying the house would be enough to get some appliances and improve and upgrade the house.  Well i know now some appliances are up there in price and it isn't the fancy pieces. also started with hardwood flooring in areas and found out the hard way that the money went fast and most of it was for the little things u do not calculate. Everything is perfect with bills and credit cards, since they have low credit.  For some of the projects ( finishing the floors, counter top for the kitcken and fixtures cost some money.  It is very easy for me to make payments, i keep at least 3 weeks -month ahead of all my bills, the 20% down gave me a really good monthly payment rate.  With my great credit score i been pre approve for the credit cards that can help, but after picking 2 and being denied after pre approve it was more hurting me with inquires.  I find it difficult to come up with 2-3k or the full price to have it at that time for somewhat big purchase for the house, np with coming up with 1-1.5k  for a down payment and go with payment but even if i had the money to back it up like always having low credit limit and now Inquiry are adding up are preventing my chance. even with a killer credit score with a mortgage. When i looked at this site going through my credit score online seeing that the payments at 300 is perfect fit in my cycle of bills for each month.  I hope luck is on my side with this just like the house because this pretty much my last hope to get the ball moving.  I have been perfect the last 5 years no late payment nothing to get to were i am at.  I take my credit and monthly payments very seriously.  This loan can finish my sections of wood flooring. grabbing the rest of the pieces to my bed room set, kitchen counter top.  upgrading the fixtures and adding some furinture to the other bedrooms.  It is this loan which i used up a credit inquiry, or ill have to wait for how long when they want raise my credit which some already which i am happy but still low.   I apologize to anyone that has read this far.  I feel that being honest will get peoples respect and that i qualify for alot of things, there are some little numbers holding me back. <br/>Thank you for your time<br/>",credit_card,A fresh start 2010,339xx,FL,2.91

I have not settled for two reasons.  One, I haven't finished treatment, and two, they have offered to settle for only $70,000.

My claim is also against my own insurance company, whom I have been with for 30 years.  In the past they have always settled claims fairly, but none of those was ever a personal injury claim.<br/><br/>I have not been, nor am I now, represented by an attorney.  I don't agree with the personal injury contingency approach to settling an accident claim.  <br/>I need one now to file suit and to provide advice on a few key issues because of the push-back IÃ¢Â€Â™m getting.  I have no intention of going to court, but I do expect to go to mediation. <br/><br/>I believe the claim is worth at least $100,000 and perhaps more.  Why do I believe that now?

The program teaches students how to think creatively, it promotes good speech/communication skills necessary for the boardroom or on stage. The students will participate in improvisational lessons as well as voice and creative movement. The lessons are also geared to help students build their self-confidence levels.<br/> I have an excellent credit rating and have never had any late payments or slow pays. I anticipate a monthly operating budget of $5,000.00-$8,000.00, which equates to 100-150 students at tuition of $600.00 per year to be paid in 3 installments of $200.00 each plus registration fees, to begin with once the program is underway in August 2010. Students will be able to enroll throughout the year at a prorated rate and therefore I anticipate the enrollment numbers to increase and likewise the monthly operating budget. My goal is to have 200 students within the first year of operations. I will be granted 20 sites (schools/community centers of my choosing) within my Northwest Phoenix territory, where I can deliver services.

Due to the recent bank regulations that took place on Feb. 22nd, many banks have upped the interest rates. I was given the choice of closing the accounts and keeping the current rate (not good for a credit score to close accounts) or keep the card and have the interest rate go up. NOW the rates are respectively 19.49% and 17.90%. To make a short story longer, the minimum payments are more interest than principal and I'm getting sucked under!

These APRs would ""be"" good until the balance is paid in full. I still have these balances with a relatively low APRs (on average ~8%) on several cards and make approximately $1500 - $2000 in payments every month, but given the changes in the credit card industry, I've started seeing the terms to pay off these balances evolving for the worse... For instance, the minimum payment on one of the balances I want to consolidate increased the minimum monthly payment by 250%!   I'm afraid the others would follow suit and then I won't be able to make the minimum monthly required payments and if I miss one payment, my APR would jack up to 30%.  This would ruin me for decades to come as I would likely try to do the right thing and pay it all off but I'm also afraid the bankruptcy abyss is where my creditors would drive me to should I not be able to come up with the minimum payments at these usurious interest rates.<br/><br/>I don't want to risk this. I want to do the right thing. <br/><br/>My financial situation:<br/>I am a good candidate for this loan because I want to do the right thing. I work very hard, have a good income, and have held steady employment since arriving in this country as an immigrant from Central America. Since 1993 I've only worked, continuously, for 2 employers and while employed put myself through school, have helped my parents purchase a home and have also purchased a small studio apartment for myself.

I wish I could say that I had the job and career (even kids) which would allow me to settle down, but I've still got a little ways to go before any of that comes to fruition.    As far as the military goes, they have paid for a decent portion of my education (which I am extremely greatful); however, anyone who is familiar with how Tuition Assistance works knows that they certainly don't pay for everything.    I can't complain, I've been given a great opportunity to continue my schooling and not everyone gets that chance.  Still, I could use some help because I desprately want to simplify the rest of my life by consolidating all of those loans into one place.

To give a bit more detail:  Credit rating - my credit report was recently run by one of the brokers I consulted for mortgage refinancing and my Credit Score is 808 with Experian, 782 with TransUnion and 811 with Equifax.  Job and Income - I work in the Finance department of a health insurance company that is an AHCCCS plan. AHCCCS is the State of Arizona's Medicaid program. The company I work for has been around for 25 years and has been servicing 3 Arizona counties. Recently, the company renewed its contract with AHCCCS and was awarded with 6 additional counties, doubling its membership. I've been with this company for 2 years, and I transferred from a sister company for which I worked for 4 years - 6 years total with the organization. I've received high marks (and corresponding raises) in my annual reviews, which, along with the solidity of the company itself, indicates that my job is very secure and the odds of me being ""downsized"" are very slim.

My husband and I have lived in the same location for 15 years, we've been married for 19 years. We have both been in the same careers for over 30 years. Our incomes are both strong and we have worked hard to build a great credit history of steady, reliable repayment over the past three years in particular.   Because credit scores don't tell the whole story, we would ask that you look at how well and how long our repayment history is on a variety of loans.  We own our own home, which is valued by the county assessor this past January at $183,000. One building on the property is planned for income producing this year.  My photography business is strong with an expected gross sales in 2009 to exceed $60,000.  My husband's income with MPRI is $168,000/year, which I manage for him since his work is overseas in Iraq. I can provide paystubs if necessary or needed.   Since we are married, our incomes are obviously intertwined, which is why I'm asking for consideration of both incomes.   Although we do carry debt, we also have the income to carry it. The majority of debt we carry have gone towards improvements on our home or to replace vehicles that we have owned and used a lot of years.

An elective surgery that I have elected to have.  My co-pay is approx 10K.  I found out last year due to some mild hip discomfort that I have congenital hip dysplasia (yes like dogs but people get it too).  The joints are slowly starting to deteriorate due to the abnormal stress of dysplasia.  If I do nothing I will be in hip replacement in 5-10 years, which I am too young for.  If I have the surgery it will correct the defect and keep me out of hip replacement possibly for good or at least for another 20-25 yrs. I have done a TON of research and am making a very well informed decision.  I am a terrific candidate for this loan because I have excellent credit, a long-term stable job and little to no debt.  I do not live beyond my means and have a small nest egg in IRAs that I have been working on (enough to cover this loan if necessary).  As a matter of fact I may end up using a part of my IRA to pay back the medical portion of this loan as you can use IRA contributions for a percentage of your medical expenses with no tax penalties.

He graduated from high school in Lima, Peru, in December 2008 and is very excited about studying in the United States. In Peru, a Bachelor degree from the United States is considered very prestigious and opens many doors to opportunities otherwise unattainable. He is currently applying for a student visa and these funds will be used to demonstrate to the United States Immigration and Citizenship Services (USCIS) the availability of liquid assets to support his educational and living expenses. Subsequent to his receiving a student visa and enrolling in courses this fall, I will cosign his private student loan applications to support the remainder of his education.  I have offered my financial support because my brother-in-law has demonstrated to me that he has the aptitude and interest for a successful career in engineering. I have spoken with him at length about my experience with the academic rigor involved in engineering coursework. He is well aware of the demands he will face and I firmly believe that he is up for the challenge.  I am currently employed with a defense contractor who has recently been the subject of many positive government and media reviews. My monthly gross income is $5867 (not including overtime pay) and my debt-to-income ratio is 16% (not including $850/month in mortgage payments). My wife also works part-time and her monthly gross income is $1250. Our daughter is 3 years old and inspires me to be a better man. We own a 2004 Buick Lesabre that we paid off in full last December. We live well within our means, which has allowed us to make significant progress in paying down our debt.  I will be happy to answer any questions you may have about my credit history, outstanding loans, employment history, and other relevant topics.

This one loan payment will simply replace all the payments I am currently making on the debts I've chosen to include in this figure. (I have not included a couple as their rates are already great and I'm making fast progress there.) I just want to accelerate my overall pay-off progress a bit by shaving a few more percentage points off interest rates and having a fixed schedule for pay-off. I have done this a couple of times already with terrific success.  Over the past several years, I have turned my financial life around penny by penny. I went from having a very low FICO, twice as much debt and several derogatory credit marks due to an isolated personal hardship, to cleaning up everything through perseverance, sacrifice and hard work. I am incredibly proud of myself and confident in my ability to become debt free in just a few more years!  My partner is self-employed and work is slow right now. We are not in trouble yet, but I want to be proactive about ""tightening up the ship"" and not spending money where I don't have to. That includes high interest rates on debt. We are already limiting our spending to necessary items. Rest assured, I am very serious about fulfilling my obligations to lenders. Financial health is my #1 priority.
